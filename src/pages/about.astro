          <p>
            Let’s Do is a small Minecraft mod collection. That is also why the logo is a chest:
            a collection belongs somewhere, and there is no better place to store it than in a chest.
          </p>

          <p>
            The focus is on adding features that are not always just rewards, upgrades,
            or efficiency improvements. Many additions exist simply to enhance decoration,
            atmosphere, and the small details that make everyday gameplay feel more alive.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each mod, with the exception of the Farm &amp; Charm collection,
            works fully on its own and can be enjoyed independently.
          </p>

          <p>
            Together, however, they form a cohesive collection that fits naturally into
            long-term worlds and keeps gameplay interesting for many hours,
            without overwhelming the player.

        A small backstory, and the idea that shaped the collection.

              Let’s Do originally started as a small commission. MissLilitu really wanted a way to make wine.
              Over time, I began adding more ideas on my own, creating new features, and shaping it into something bigger.
              One project slowly turned into a collection.
            </p>

            <p>
              The motivation was never only personal, like learning new things, improving, and being creative.
              It was also about building something that often gets overlooked: atmosphere, everyday interactions,
              the feeling of living in a world, and simply slowing things down a little.
            </p>

            <p>
              The goal is not to reinvent features or make everything “better”.
              It is about thoughtful additions that blend in naturally and feel at home in normal gameplay.
            </p>

            <div class="aboutCallout">
              Let’s Do is made for long-term worlds: install it once and keep it, because it keeps adding value
              without demanding constant attention.

              First and foremost, it’s you. The players who play the mods, enjoy them,
              give feedback, report issues, and support the project in countless ways.
              Let’s Do would not exist in this form without its community.
            </p>

            <p>
              But there are also people actively helping to push the Let’s Do collection forward:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>MissLilitu</strong><br />
              Idea giver, feedback source, and the original spark behind the project.
              Without the wish to finally produce wine, Let’s Do would likely never have started.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Tsuyumori</strong><br />
              The youngest adult in the room. Rendering wizard, visual perfectionist,
              and always around with advice. Has an annoying tendency to be right.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>CR-055</strong><br />
              Not your typical Discord moderator. Keeps the crowd and their requests in check
              and somehow manages to bring order into chaos.
            </p>

            <p>
              And of course many more helped shape Let’s Do into what it is today:
              Cristelknight, Jason13Official, BaumeisterJo, Flower, Jamie, Raymond, Noah,
              Plantkillable, Iri, Myst, and many, many others.

            <p>
              If you enjoy the mods and would like to support their continued development,
              Patreon is a simple and entirely optional way to do so.
            </p>

            <p>
              Support helps cover development time, assets, and long-term maintenance,
              and allows me to keep improving the collection at a sustainable pace.
