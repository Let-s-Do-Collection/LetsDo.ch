          <summary class="faqQ">What is Architectury API and why is it required?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            Architectury API is a shared library that allows mods to run on multiple modloaders using a single codebase.
            All Let’s Do mods are built on Architectury to ensure consistent behavior across platforms. Architectury API
            is always required, no matter which modloader you use.

          <summary class="faqQ">Why do I need Fabric API when using Fabric?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            Fabric API provides core hooks and functionality used by many Fabric mods, including Let’s Do. When running
            Let’s Do mods on Fabric, both Architectury API and Fabric API must be installed.

          <div class="faqA">
            If a required API is missing, Minecraft will usually fail to start and display an error message listing the
            missing dependency. This simply means a required library has not been installed yet.

            Development currently focuses on Minecraft 1.21.1 and will likely stay there for a while. We prefer to take
            our time and do things properly. Where it goes from here, we’ll see.

          <summary class="faqQ">Do I need other dependencies?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            Architectury API is always required. When using Fabric, Fabric API is required as well. Additional
            dependencies may exist depending on the mod and are always listed on the mod page.

            Some mods already include configuration options. If you don’t see a config yet, it simply means it’s planned
            for the future and will be added as the mod continues to grow.

            Yes, modpacks are absolutely allowed. You may include Let’s Do mods in modpacks distributed via official
            platforms such as Modrinth or CurseForge. However, re-uploading, redistributing, or modifying the original
            mod files themselves is not permitted. Always link back to the official download page.

            Install a compatible modloader such as Fabric or NeoForge. Then install Architectury API. If you are using
            Fabric, Fabric API is required as well. Download the Let’s Do mod jar and place it into your Minecraft mods
            folder. Launch the game and verify the mods show up in the Mods list.

          <div class="faqA">
            Yes. As long as other mods rely on vanilla biome tags, Let’s Do world generation will integrate alongside
            them. For example world generation mods like Terralith work seamlessly. Just keep in mind that worldgen
            features will only show up in new chunks.

            Sodium- and Rubidium-based performance mods generally work well. In some cases, custom renderers may behave
            differently depending on the rendering setup.

          <div class="faqA">
            This message refers to Minecraft’s DataFixerUpper, a system Minecraft uses to update and convert very old
            world data between versions. Let’s Do mods do not rely on DataFixers, as changes are handled directly within
            the mod logic. The message is harmless and can safely be ignored.

          <div class="faqA">
            Resource packs are a vanilla Minecraft system used to change visuals and audio. They control textures,
            models, animations, particles, UI elements, fonts, and sounds. Resource packs do not change gameplay logic.

          <div class="faqA">
            Some Let’s Do mods include optional built-in resource packs for specific features such as bushy leaves
            or CTM support. These packs are optional and can be enabled in the Resource Packs menu if available.

          <div class="faqA">
            Yes. You can create a resource pack that overrides Let’s Do textures or models. This works the same way as
            overriding vanilla assets. Only visual elements can be changed through resource packs.

          <div class="faqA">
            Datapacks are a vanilla Minecraft system that allows changing or extending game behavior using JSON files.
            They operate on the server side and can modify recipes, loot tables, tags, advancements, and world
            generation. Let’s Do mods expose many internal features through datapacks to allow customization without
            code changes.

          <summary class="faqQ">How do I create a datapack for a Let’s Do mod?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            The easiest way is to look at the mod’s built-in datapack. You can open the mod jar and inspect the data
            folder, or view it directly on GitHub. Copy the files you want to change and place them into your own
            datapack. Only the files you modify need to be included.

        <details class="faqItem" data-search="how can datapacks be loaded">
          <summary class="faqQ">How can datapacks be loaded?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            Datapacks can be placed directly into a world’s datapacks folder. Alternatively, mods like OpenLoader or
            Global Datapacks can load datapacks globally across all worlds. Datapacks are applied when a world is loaded
            or reloaded.

          <div class="faqA">
            Datapacks can be used to change recipes, loot tables, mob drops, tags, and world generation behavior. Many
            Let’s Do features are controlled through tags, allowing you to enable, disable, or extend behavior. This
            includes things like spawn rules, interactions, and structure placement.
