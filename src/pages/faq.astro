          <summary class="faqQ">Is there a config file?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            Some mods include config options.

            Are Let’s Do mods compatible with worldgen mods?

          <div class="faqA">
            Yes. As long as those mods use vanilla biome tags,

            Do Let’s Do mods work with Sodium / Rubidium / Optifine?

            Sodium and Rubidium generally work, though visual glitches may occur with custom renderers.
            Optifine is not officially supported and often causes issues.
            Sodium-based performance mods are recommended.

            Minecraft’s DataFixerUpper is used to upgrade very old world data.
            Let’s Do mods do not rely on it and handle changes directly.
