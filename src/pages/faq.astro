            All Let’s Do mods are built on Architectury and work on both Fabric and NeoForge.

          <summary class="faqQ">Which Minecraft versions are supported?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            Development currently focuses on Minecraft 1.21.1 and will likely stay there for a while. We prefer to take our time and do things properly – where it goes from here, we’ll see.          </div>

        <details class="faqItem">
          <summary class="faqQ">Do I need other dependencies?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            Architectury API is always required.
            When using Fabric, Fabric API is required as well.
            Additional dependencies may exist depending on the mod and are always listed on the mod page.

        <details class="faqItem">
          <summary class="faqQ">Is there a config file?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
Some mods already include configuration options.
If you don’t see a config yet, it simply means it’s planned for the future and will be added as the mod continues to grow.

          <summary class="faqQ">Can I use Let’s Do in my modpack?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
Yes, modpacks are absolutely allowed.
You are free to include Let’s Do mods in modpacks distributed via Modrinth or CurseForge.
Please do not re-upload, redistribute, or modify the original mod files themselves.

          <summary class="faqQ">What are datapacks and how do they work?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            Datapacks are a vanilla Minecraft system that allows changing or extending game behavior using JSON files.
            They operate on the server side and can modify recipes, loot tables, tags, advancements, and world generation.
            Let’s Do mods expose many internal features through datapacks to allow customization without code changes.

        </details>

        <details class="faqItem">
          <summary class="faqQ">How do I create a datapack for a Let’s Do mod?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            The easiest way is to look at the mod’s built-in datapack.
            You can open the mod jar and inspect the data folder, or view it directly on GitHub.
            Copy the files you want to change and place them into your own datapack.
            Only the files you modify need to be included.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faqItem">
          <summary class="faqQ">How can datapacks be loaded?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            Datapacks can be placed directly into a world’s datapacks folder.
            Alternatively, mods like OpenLoader or Global Datapacks can load datapacks globally across all worlds.
            Datapacks are applied when a world is loaded or reloaded.

        </details>

        <details class="faqItem">
          <summary class="faqQ">What can I change using datapacks?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            Datapacks can be used to change recipes, loot tables, mob drops, tags, and world generation behavior.
            Many Let’s Do features are controlled through tags, allowing you to enable, disable, or extend behavior.
            This includes things like spawn rules, interactions, and structure placement.

          <summary class="faqQ">What are resource packs?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            Resource packs are a vanilla Minecraft system used to change visuals and audio.
            They control textures, models, animations, particles, UI elements, fonts, and sounds.
            Resource packs do not change gameplay logic.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faqItem">
          <summary class="faqQ">How does Let’s Do use resource packs?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            Let’s Do mods include built-in resources for custom textures, models, particles, and animations.
            These resources define the visual style of each mod and are loaded automatically.
            Custom resource packs can override these assets if desired.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faqItem">
          <summary class="faqQ">Can I create my own resource pack for Let’s Do?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            Yes. You can create a resource pack that overrides Let’s Do textures or models.
            This works the same way as overriding vanilla assets.
            Only visual elements can be changed through resource packs.

          <summary class="faqQ">Are Let’s Do mods compatible with worldgen mods?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
Yes. As long as other mods rely on vanilla biome tags, Let’s Do world generation will integrate alongside them.
For example world generation mods like Terralith work seamlessly.
Just keep in mind that worldgen features will only show up in new chunks.

        <details class="faqItem">
          <summary class="faqQ">Do Let’s Do mods work with performance mods?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
            Sodium- and Rubidium-based performance mods generally work well.
            In some cases, custom renderers may behave differently depending on the rendering setup.

        <details class="faqItem">
          <summary class="faqQ">Why do I see “No data fixer registered” in the logs?</summary>
          <div class="faqA">
         This message refers to Minecraft’s DataFixerUpper, a system Minecraft uses to update and convert very old world data between versions.
         Let’s Do mods do not rely on DataFixers, as changes are handled directly within the mod logic.
         The message is harmless and can safely be ignored.
