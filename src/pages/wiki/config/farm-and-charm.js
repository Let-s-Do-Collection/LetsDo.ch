  aboutText: `Welcome to the Farm & Charm Wiki.

This is your home for blocks, items, mechanics, and quick guidance for Farm & Charm.

Farm & Charm is the food focused foundation of the Let’s Do Food ecosystem. It helps shared systems work together across mods, especially around cooking, processing, storage, and agriculture.

And of course it also adds a lot of cozy farming content, from practical tools to decorative details that feel right at home in survival gameplay.
